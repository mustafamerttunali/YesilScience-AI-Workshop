# YesilScience-AI-Workshop
This repository contains workshop materials from the AI Workshop, Yesil Science.

# Week 1
## Introduction to OpenCV
*  Read an image using OpenCV
*  Capture videos from camera
*  Drawing Functions
*  Mouse Events
*  Creating a trackbar


# Week 2 - Yeditepe University
## Machine Learning -  Artificial Neural Network
We talked about What machine learning is, machine learning algorithms, supervised and unsupervised learning, artificial neural networks and numpy.

*  Basic artificial neural network.


# Week 3 - Yesil Society
## Representation of Single Neuron Mathematical State of Artificial Neural Network from Scratch
In this workshop directory , it contains the complete coding of the artificial neural network using only numpy. This workshop is organized as part of the Yesil Society event. In this workshop, we used a cat dataset which we took it from Coursera. ("lr_utils)

* Pre-processing (Vector operations, shape and reshape)
* Mathematical  notation of the algorithm
* Training and predict
* Cat Classification

## Deep Learning and CNN [Google Colabs] - by Ömer Özgür
* Pre-processing 
* Training and predict with using Keras.
* MobileNetV2
* Butterfly Classification
